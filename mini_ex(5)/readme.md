The Novel Mixer : https://mikkelabildgaard.github.io/All-mini-ex/mini_ex(5)/

This program has used a few elements from the RiTa Library. The program is most importantly based on the generate.sentences function.
The function allows the program to mix different sentences into a certain textpiece. In my case i had chosen two classic novels
from two different centuries: John Steinbecks "Of Mice and Men" and E.L James' "Fifty Shades of Grey". The contrasts between
these books are expressed both through language, action and purposeness. The mixing of sentences creates an humoristic angle
towards the mixture of these novels.

Besides the Ri.Markov function, i played around with different font types downloaded from the internet. I also unsuccesfully
tried to use different functions from Ri.Marko, however i couldn't make it work. The RiTa Library was very poor in its
functionality. It seems as my editor wouldn't use the different functions, which i intended. 

The materiality of text/intercace and our understanding of the “textual character” of the found text.
