Selected Coding Challenge: Random Walker

My added syntax, was a slider which controlled the framerate. This was probably an unambitious approach this excercise. However this way how it ended up. I drew inspiration from our earlier work with the DOM projects, and hereby i thought of making a slider. It's easy to illustrate the difference between a slow and fast framerate in a project. My focus on this excercise was making the flowchart. 

One of the challenges in this excercise was really narrowing the program down into small bits. A program really consists of a lot more elements thn you actually see. Another challenge was actually fully understanding Daniel Shiffmans programs in depth. Some of the first coding challenges, which i looked at, were very complex. 

Flowcharts are useful at creating an overview for the eniter program. In addition to this, finding solutions, possibilities or even constraints is another force of using flowcharts. For people with no experience in programming, it is also a big easy for them to understand.
