The design of my throbber

Designing this throbber has been a rollercoaster of emotions. The focus was to keep the circular throbber design but  exploring and focusing on the aesthetics. The first thought was to design a spaceship flying around any planet. However working with this was too complicated, so i had to adjust my ambitions. 
My final design is a fish swimming around a "loading" text. I followed the rotating, circular model which was given to us by Winnie. It was a bit difficult placing the shapes in the right direction after everything had been centered through the push(); and pop(); codes. I also had some problems loading a picture into the design. I originally wanted a pictore of some coral under the "loading" text, but i could not make it work.
